# messenger-clone
This is the demo of messenger. I have used mern(mongodb, express, react, node). If you want to see the project then clone/download the project go to the terminal and cd backend for backend and cd messenger for frontend and after that enter npm start for both frontend and backend. For backend you can see the project in localhost:9000 and for front end react will automatically run in 3000 port. Thank you. happy coding
